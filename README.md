## 👨‍💻 About me

I'm finishing up my engineering degree at Ryerson University, but half way through studying eng I fell in love with software so I started learning it as fast as I could. Once I got going, I did many projects and as well as internships in software and I am now happily pursuing my career in the software industry! Oh, I almost forogt to mention that I got my [AWS Solutions Architect Associate](https://www.certmetrics.com/amazon/public/transcript.aspx?transcript=FNGF53GCK1BE1TKG) Certificate! 

## ✨ My Interests Outside of Software

- 🏐 Playing beach volleyball or ultimate frisbee with friends
- ⛺️ camping on the weekends
- 📖 Reading a good book in the evening
