## About me

I'm finishing up my engineering degree at Ryerson University. While studying engineering I fell in love with Software so I learn't all about Web Dev and even done work with mobile apps both professionally and for projects. Now I am now happily pursuing my career in Software.

## My Interests Outside of Software

- Playing beach volleyball or ultimate frisbee with friends
- Hammocking (camping with hammocks) on the weekends
- Reading a good book in the evening

Feel free to get in touch with me on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesdouitsis/) or by [email](mailto:jamesdouitsis@gmail.com)
