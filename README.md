## 👨‍💻 About me

I'm finishing up my engineering degree at Ryerson University, but half way through studying eng I fell in love with software so I started learning it as fast as I could. Once I got going, I did many projects and as well as internships in software and I am now happily pursuing my career in the software industry! 

## ✨ My Interests Outside of Software

- 🏐 Playing beach volleyball or ultimate frisbee with friends
- ⛺️ camping on the weekends
- 📖 Reading a good book in the evening

Feel free to get in touch with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesdouitsis/) or by email ([jamesdouitsis@gmail.com](mailto:jamesdouitsis@gmail.com)). Also, feel free to checkout my resume if you haven't already 😊
